            <h2>Narrative</h2>
            <p>The project artifact that I chose to demonstrate Software Design and Engineering is from CS 340
                – Client/Server Development and was created in April 2023. In this project, there is a Dash Plotly
                application that renders a UI to display information from a MongoDB database. The skills and 
                abilities I wish do demonstrate is in the creation of the UI and its use of the HTML/CSS libraries. 
                The are Python libraries that are used within Jupyter Notebooks. The skills and abilities in 
                Software Development that I would like to focus on is in having the capability to learn new syntax 
                and ways of programming within a given time frame as I only had a few weeks to learn how to work 
                with Dash Plotly and have the project be functional.

                To also demonstrate proficiency in Software Design and Engineering, and the ability to learn another 
                language, my enhancement is to create a Windows WPF Application that has a similar UI. In doing this,
                I had to learn how to work with the XAML to create the UI, along with Object-Oriented programing 
                with the action calls to the buttons. In addition, the original CS 340 project had “in-text” username
                and password stored as variables. For this reason, I chose to create another screen to prompt for a
                username and password to allow for make changes to the data. This then opens to another screen that
                allows for CRUD operations with textboxes for each field.

            <img src="./images/UpdateWindow.png" height="300px" alt="WPF Login Screen"/>
            <p>
                The course outcomes for Software Design and Engineering were met by having completed the WPF 
                application. I demonstrated this by taking a design written in one application and converted into 
                another. The addition of a Login Screen also showcases the implementation of security that was not 
                included in the original project. As with any new project, a bit of planning is involved. However, 
                with the help of the designing tools provided by Microsoft, creating the WPF application’s UI was 
                not too difficult to conceptualize.

            <p>
                The learning of both of these projects had their own respective challenges. First with the Dash 
                Plotly, I had to import the python module that held the CRUD definitions to the MongoDB to display 
                the required data. The next piece to the puzzle was in the HTML syntax. It was not until after 
                this course that I took a course on HTML and CSS, so these were also new concepts to learn with 
                HTML tags and headers. I needed to search online for the Dash Plotly libraries along with the HTML 
                and CSS to generate the layout. For the DataGrid, this was possible with using a table method, then 
                passing the required Pandas Data Frame with the data from MongoDB. When learning to create the WPF 
                application, designing the UI was not too difficult to learn. However, the difficulty came with 
                learning to create meaningful names to the buttons being used in the XAML code and their actions. 
                This lead to the object-oriented aspect of the C# code written to perform the required functions 
                when interacting with the buttons.
