                My journey in the Computer Science program has taught me many valuable skills. These skills 
                include the foundation of computer programming with languages such as Python, Java, HTML/CSS, 
                C++, and C#. It has taught me how to utilize object-oriented programming, data analysis 
                techniques, version control, along with the Agile methodology, testing and working with teams. 
                I have also learned to work with data sources such as MySQL or SQL, and MongoDB, including the 
                differences between relational and non-relational databases. All of these skill, will help me 
                further my future aspirations of becoming a Software or Web Developer.

                When it comes to working within a team, there are two courses that come to mind - CS 310 - 
                Collaboration and Team Project, and an elective course CS 465 - Full Stack Development I. In CS 
                310 - Collaboration and Team Project, I learned to work with Git and version control. We also 
                had to work as a team by pushing our commits and merging the branches. The challenge was in 
                learning how to merge branches without removing the work of someone else, but this process became 
                second nature after learning to 'fetch' the most recent updates and utilizing tools to see 
                differences and to make the necessary adjustments before merging. In CS 465 - Full Stack 
                Development, we took full advantage of the general discussion board to help each other with the 
                assignments. The challenge this course presented was that the versioning of MongoDB changed in 
                comparison to the tutorials set up for the course. We successfully navigated the course by sharing 
                our experiences on how to set up our environments locally. I, for one, had the opportunity to 
                start on this early, thus having experienced many of these challenges initially and provided help. 
                Later in this course, I was the one needing assistance and was able to find others that had similar 
                problems.

                With communicating to stakeholders, CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle introduced me to the 
                Agile Development methodology. In this, we had projects that required “sprints” as part of the 
                course development projects. In this, I learned how to work with 'user stories' as well as create 
                'test cases'. These aspects of the SDLC helps in determining what the stakeholders are requesting 
                for their programs. This also helps the development team by breaking down the overall software into 
                smaller, manageable tasks to be completed.

                For Software Engineering and Databases, I come back to CS 340 - Client Server Development. I started 
                this course by learning MongoDB. I first created the database, imported the existing .csv datastore, 
                then learned how to query the MongoDB. From this, I learned how to create the connection string to 
                MongoDB and create CRUD methods using the PyMongo library. From there, and by using the data-first 
                method, I was then introduced to Plotly Dash. In this I imported the python program to then create a 
                “dashboard” to return filters on the specific data that was requested by the stakeholder.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Data Structures and Algorithms, one of the courses I can use as an example of learning is 
                CS 330 - Computer Graphics and Visualization. In this course, I was introduced to OpenGL. The course 
                took me through how to create a 3D model using the C++ library. For this, I had to define the widow 
                size, implement keyboard and mouse controls, and define the coordinate system to create triangles to 
                then create complex structures. These complex structures included cylindrical, spherical, torus, and 
                cone structures to design a 3D model. I had to create multiple buffer array objects to store the shape, 
                then transform and translate the object to the desired location in the 3D space.
